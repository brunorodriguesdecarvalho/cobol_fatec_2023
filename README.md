# COBOL Exercises :computer:

This repository contains a collection of [COBOL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COBOL) exercises that I'm working on as part of my programming learning journey.

## About COBOL :bar_chart:

COBOL (COmmon Business Oriented Language) is a high-level programming language specifically created for business applications. It is one of the oldest languages still in use today, having been created in 1959. COBOL is still widely used in legacy systems in financial institutions, insurance companies, and other organizations that process large amounts of business data.

## Repository Structure :file_folder

This repository is structured as follows:

EMXX/\
├── EXYY/\
│&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;├── exYY.pdf\
│&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;└── other files (input, output, cbl files, logs, etc...)

Each "EMXX" folder corresponds to an Exercise of Machine, and contains between 3 and 8 "EXYY" folders, each corresponding to a different exercise. The "YY" number ranges from 1 to 8.

Each "EXYY" folder contains a "exYY.pdf" file, which describes the exercise in Portuguese, and a "exercise.cbl" file, which contains the COBOL source code for the exercise. Some exercises also include a corresponding "exercise.out" file that shows the program output when executed.

## Running the Programs :running:

To run the COBOL programs in this repository, you will need to have a COBOL compiler installed on your machine. The programs have been tested using the [GnuCOBOL](https://sourceforge.net/projects/open-cobol/) (formerly known as OpenCOBOL) compiler, which is a free and open-source COBOL compiler. To compile and run a COBOL program, simply follow the instructions in the corresponding "exYY.pdf" file inside the "EXYY" folder.

## Contributions :raised_hands:

If you would like to contribute to this repository, feel free to send a [pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests). I'll be happy to review any contribution that can help improve the exercises or make them more useful for other COBOL students.
